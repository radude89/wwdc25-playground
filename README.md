## Overview

This repository serves as an experimental playground for exploring and demonstrating the groundbreaking technologies introduced at Apple's WWDC 2025. Here you'll find hands-on demo projects, code samples, and practical implementations of the latest Apple frameworks and APIs using Xcode 26.

## What's Inside

### ðŸŽ¨ Liquid Glass Design System
Explore Apple's revolutionary new UI material that combines glass-like optics with fluid, responsive interactivity:
- Custom controls with `glassEffect` modifier
- Glass button styles and toolbar customizations
- Dynamic app icons with Icon Composer
- Background extension effects for immersive experiences

### ðŸ§  Apple Intelligence & Foundation Models
Harness the power of on-device AI with Apple's new Foundation Models Framework:
- Local LLM integration for text processing
- `@Generable` Swift data structures for structured AI output
- Tool calling with autonomous Swift functions
- Privacy-first, offline AI capabilities

### âš¡ Swift 6.2 Performance Features
Leverage the latest Swift language improvements:
- Inline arrays for stack-based performance
- Span type for safe memory operations
- Enhanced concurrency with main actor defaults
- Improved C++ interoperability

### ðŸ“± SwiftUI & Platform Updates
Modern UI development with enhanced SwiftUI capabilities:
- Declarative `WebView` integration
- Rich text editing with attributed strings
- 3D charts with RealityKit integration
- Cross-platform consistency across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS

### ðŸ¥½ visionOS 26 Spatial Computing
Next-generation spatial experiences:
- Volumetric APIs for 3D layouts
- Environment occlusion for realistic AR
- Nearby window sharing for collaborative experiences
- Immersive media support (180Â°, 360Â°, wide-FOV video)

### ðŸŽ® Gaming & Metal 4
Advanced graphics and gaming capabilities:
- Neural rendering with ML inference in shaders
- MetalFX upscaling and frame interpolation
- GameSave framework for cloud saves
- Game Center social features
